Let's talk about classes, or as other games may call them, jobs. There are **9 Normal classes** plus **3 additional Successor classes** in PSO2. Each class fullfills a specific role in terms of what they do. However, unlike other standard RPGs, PSO2 does not follow what some may call, the "holy trinity", which are heals, tank, DPS. The general gameplay in which PSO2 follows, is fast paced action. Thus it is highly recommended that players should obtain skills and adjust their gameplay for the nature of the game itself.

PSO2 allows players to take two classes at the same time, this is called **Subclassing**. By taking a subclass, your main class takes 10% of the stats of the class you took as a subclass (except PP). Subclasses will also receive 25% (50% if Summoner) of the experience that the main class is given until the subclass reaches Lv.75.
Only 9 out of the 12 classes can take a subclass, and only 14 out of the 15 classes can be used as a subclass. All classes are able to wield a Gunslash.

Let's start by examining each class at a glance. We won't go over into detail on how to play each class, but will give a brief summary of what they do and how they play.

# Normal Classes
The Normal Classes are the 9 standard classes that can be played right out of the box without needing any sort of special requirement.

### Hunter (HU)
A class that focuses on melee combat. Utilizing **Swords, Wired Lances, and Partizans**, Hunter boasts a varied arsenal of strong Striking-type weaponry and a Skill Tree that promotes both offensive and defensive play, 
making it well suited for solo and beginner players.

<strong>ARKS-Visiphone Wiki description on Hunter's weaponry:</strong>

<strong>Swords</strong>
> A large broadsword used for heavy melee strikes. What it lacks in speed, it makes up for in raw damage. The Sword is a jack-of-all-trades weapon, possessing utility in almost any situation and being capable in a variety of areas. However, it lacks range compared to its other Hunter weapon counterparts. Swords can be powered up by the Skill '''Sword Gear''', which grants them faster charge speeds and a variety of bonuses for staying on the offensive.
> Sword's Weapon Action is ''Guard''. By holding the Weapon Action Button, any attacks dealt to you will inflict sharply reduced damage and minimal knockback at the cost of PP.

<strong>Wired Lances</strong>
> A pair of blades hooked to handles by an extendable cable. The specialized blades are capable of striking targets far and wide, at the cost of some raw damage. Wired Lances also excel in grappling targets, manipulating their positions and using them to strike other foes around them. Wired Lances can be powered up by the Skill '''Wired Lance Gear''', which allows them to expend Gear built up by attacking to boost the strength of their grapple-type attacks.
> Wired Lance's Weapon Action is ''Guard''. By holding the Weapon Action Button, any attacks dealt to you will inflict sharply reduced damage and minimal knockback at the cost of PP.

<strong>Partizans</strong>
> A long, bladed spear. Despite not having the sheer strength of a Sword, the Partizan makes up for it in its other attributes, with a solid attack speed and great range and mobility with its Photon Arts. The Partizan user can twirl their weapon following the usage of an attack or Photon Art to quickly restore PP, granting them excellent battlefield control as well. Partizans can be powered up by the Skill '''Partizan Gear''', which allows them to expend Gear built up by twirling their Partizan to boost the strength of their Photon Arts.
> Partizan's Weapon Action is ''Guard''. By holding the Weapon Action Button, any attacks dealt to you will inflict sharply reduced damage and minimal knockback at the cost of PP.

Upon reaching Lv.75 as a Hunter, you can claim a <a href="#">**Title Reward**</a> that grants all characters on your account **HP +50, R-ATK +15, and S-DEF +40**.

### Ranger (RA)
A class that utilizes mid-range weaponry for ranged combat that specializes in mid-range "supportive" DPS that shines best against large enemies and large enemy groups. A Ranger's weapons include **Assault Rifles and Launchers**.

<strong>ARKS-Visiphone Wiki description on Ranger's weaponry:</strong>

**Assault Rifles**
> A heavy-duty rifle loaded with bullets. Possesses a high rate of attack as well as extreme precision. Its Photon Arts augment its abilities, enabling it to adapt to many battlefield situations. Assault Rifles can be further strengthened with the use of Bullet Skills, which allow the user to load in special magazines that give their attacks special properties.

**Launchers**
> A slow, but deadly rocket launcher. Has terrible attack speed, but compensates in extremely high raw damage. Its attacks not only hit hard, but also have a blast radius that can hit multiple enemies in an area simultaneously, making it an excellent tool for taking down groups of enemies. Launchers can be further strengthened with the use of Shot Skills, which allow the user to load in special cartridges that can debilitate enemies.

When you reach Lv.75 as a Ranger, you can unlock a <a href="#">**Title Reward**</a> which grants you **R-ATK +20, T-ATK +20, and R-DEF +40**.

### Force (FO)

### Fighter (FI)

### Gunner (GU)

### Techer (TE)

### Braver (BR)

### Bouncer (BO)

### Summoner (SU)

# Successor Classes
Unlike the 9 previous classes, Successor Classes are powerful classes that use weaponry from the other classes with new abilities and skills. Because of this, they're unable to use subclasses when used as a main class. However, only Phantom and Etoile can be used as a subclass, but are unable to use their PAs unless they're set as the main class.

You're able to play a Successor Class by leveling two classes to Lv.75 and completing a [Client Order](#).

### Hero (HR)
A class that specializes in fighting groups of enemies. Utilizing Swords, Twin Machineguns and Talises, Heroes are able to handle all combat situations with ease, using their superior offensive abilities and agility; as well as their ability to seamlessly cycle their weapons mid-combo.

#### Weapon differences between other classes
|**Swords**|**Twin Machineguns**|**Talises**|
|----------|--------------------|-----------|
| Swords are held with one hand, instead of being held with two. Thus allowing for faster swinging animations. | Twin Machineguns lack the stylish roll ability from Gunner. | Talis has its own Photon Arts. Is also capable of using techs. |
| Weapon Action: **Energy Blast** - Fire bolts of Photon energy. Long pressing charges the blast and lets you fire an even larger bolt. | Normal attacks consume PP. | Weapon action: **Agile Shift** - Allows you to set a warp point by long pressing the Weapon Action button, short tapping the Weapon Action button will cause you to teleport to that location. |
| | Weapon action: **Reload** - Recovers PP by twirling your TMGs. By doing a JA on a Reload will perform a Just Reload, which is a faster PP regeneration. | Can perform Step Attacks instead of Mirage Step. |
