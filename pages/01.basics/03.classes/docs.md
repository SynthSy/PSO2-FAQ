<hr>
Let's talk about classes, or as other games may call them, jobs. There are **9 Normal classes** plus **3 additional Successor classes** in PSO2. Each class fullfills a specific role in terms of what they do. However, unlike other standard RPGs, PSO2 does not follow what some may call, the "holy trinity", which are heals, tank, DPS. The general gameplay in which PSO2 follows, is fast paced action. Thus it is highly recommended that players should obtain skills and adjust their gameplay for the nature of the game itself.

PSO2 allows players to take two classes at the same time, this is called **Subclassing**. By taking a subclass, your main class takes 10% of the stats of the class you took as a subclass (except PP). Subclasses will also receive 25% (50% if Summoner) of the experience that the main class is given until the subclass reaches Lv.75.
Only 9 out of the 12 classes can take a subclass, and only 14 out of the 15 classes can be used as a subclass. All classes are able to wield a Gunslash.

Let's start by examining each class at a glance. We won't go over into detail on how to play each class, but will give a brief summary of what they do and how they play.

<hr>

# Normal Classes
The Normal Classes are the 9 standard classes that can be played right out of the box without needing any sort of special requirement.

<h3 id="hunter">Hunter (HU)</h3>
A class that focuses on melee combat. Utilizing **Swords, Wired Lances, and Partizans**, Hunter boasts a varied arsenal of strong Striking-type (S-ATK) weaponry and a Skill Tree that promotes both offensive and defensive play, 
making it well suited for solo and beginner players.

<strong>ARKS-Visiphone Wiki description on Hunter's weaponry:</strong>

<strong>Swords</strong>
> A large broadsword used for heavy melee strikes. What it lacks in speed, it makes up for in raw damage. The Sword is a jack-of-all-trades weapon, possessing utility in almost any situation and being capable in a variety of areas. However, it lacks range compared to its other Hunter weapon counterparts. Swords can be powered up by the Skill '''Sword Gear''', which grants them faster charge speeds and a variety of bonuses for staying on the offensive.
> Sword's Weapon Action is ''Guard''. By holding the Weapon Action Button, any attacks dealt to you will inflict sharply reduced damage and minimal knockback at the cost of PP.

<strong>Wired Lances</strong>
> A pair of blades hooked to handles by an extendable cable. The specialized blades are capable of striking targets far and wide, at the cost of some raw damage. Wired Lances also excel in grappling targets, manipulating their positions and using them to strike other foes around them. Wired Lances can be powered up by the Skill '''Wired Lance Gear''', which allows them to expend Gear built up by attacking to boost the strength of their grapple-type attacks.
> Wired Lance's Weapon Action is ''Guard''. By holding the Weapon Action Button, any attacks dealt to you will inflict sharply reduced damage and minimal knockback at the cost of PP.

<strong>Partizans</strong>
> A long, bladed spear. Despite not having the sheer strength of a Sword, the Partizan makes up for it in its other attributes, with a solid attack speed and great range and mobility with its Photon Arts. The Partizan user can twirl their weapon following the usage of an attack or Photon Art to quickly restore PP, granting them excellent battlefield control as well. Partizans can be powered up by the Skill '''Partizan Gear''', which allows them to expend Gear built up by twirling their Partizan to boost the strength of their Photon Arts.
> Partizan's Weapon Action is ''Guard''. By holding the Weapon Action Button, any attacks dealt to you will inflict sharply reduced damage and minimal knockback at the cost of PP.

Upon reaching Lv.75 as a Hunter, you can claim a <a href="#">**Title Reward**</a> that grants all characters on your account **HP +50, R-ATK +15, and S-DEF +40**.

<h3 id="ranger">Ranger (RA)</h3>
A class that utilizes mid-range weaponry for ranged (R-ATK) combat that specializes in mid-range "supportive" DPS that shines best against large enemies and large enemy groups. A Ranger's weapons include **Assault Rifles and Launchers**.

<strong>ARKS-Visiphone Wiki description on Ranger's weaponry:</strong>

**Assault Rifles**
> A heavy-duty rifle loaded with bullets. Possesses a high rate of attack as well as extreme precision. Its Photon Arts augment its abilities, enabling it to adapt to many battlefield situations. Assault Rifles can be further strengthened with the use of Bullet Skills, which allow the user to load in special magazines that give their attacks special properties.

**Launchers**
> A slow, but deadly rocket launcher. Has terrible attack speed, but compensates in extremely high raw damage. Its attacks not only hit hard, but also have a blast radius that can hit multiple enemies in an area simultaneously, making it an excellent tool for taking down groups of enemies. Launchers can be further strengthened with the use of Shot Skills, which allow the user to load in special cartridges that can debilitate enemies.

When you reach Lv.75 as a Ranger, you can unlock a <a href="#">**Title Reward**</a> which grants you **R-ATK +20, T-ATK +15, and R-DEF +40**.

<h3 id="force">Force (FO)</h3>
A class that focuses on dealing damage with techs. With access to techs, the class is an effective damage dealer at almost any range, with a decent amount of supportive capabilities. It is also one of the only two classes with access to **Compound Techs**. Force uses **Rods and Talises** as weapons.

<strong>ARKS-Visiphone Wiki description on Force's weaponry:</strong>

**Rod**
> A long-shafted weapon augmented for Technique casting. The Rod class of weapon possesses much higher T-ATK than any of its Tech weapon counterparts and has extremely high PP recovery, but has poor striking range and low melee damage to compensate. Techs cast with a Rod make the caster the Technique point of origin.

**Talis**
> Talis are Technique casting weapons that can be thrown to manipulate the focal point of technique casting. Effectively, this can allow the player to cast techs from different positions without actually moving. However, Talises possess lower T-ATK than Rods to balance their superior mobility and more accessible range.

When you reach Lv.75 as a Force, you can unlock a <a href="#">**Title Reward**</a> which grants you **R-ATK +15, T-ATK +20, and T-DEF +40**.

<h3 id="fighter">Fighter (FI)</h3>
A class that specializes in aggressive melee combat. Fighter's Skills give the user more power when under specific, often disadvantageous, conditions. Utilizing **Twin Daggers, Double Sabers, and Knuckles** as its weapons, a Fighter's strength scales with the proficiency of the player.

<strong>ARKS-Visiphone Wiki description on Fighter's weaponry:</strong>

**Twin Daggers**
> Short-range daggers that excel at aerial combat. Capable of extremely fast attacks with multiple hits, and multiple PAs that allow maneuvering in all directions, both horizontally and vertically. Twin Dagger attacks and PAs also have very brief frontal Just Guard frames, allowing continuous offensive play if timed right. However, because PAs are so fast, it tends to also consume PP much faster than most other weapons. Twin Daggers can be powered up with the Skill '''Twin Daggers Gear''', which grants them a damage bonus for staying airborne and performing multiple midair "jumps".  
> Twin Daggers' Weapon Action is ''Spin''. Pressing the Weapon Action button will cause the player to spin in the air. This counts as a jump for '''Twin Daggers Gear''', deals minor damage at point-blank range, and blocks attacks with Just Guard frames.

**Double Sabers**
> Short-range bladed weapons that are capable of dishing out a multitude of hits in a single combo. Double Saber PAs generally have multiple hits (but slower than Twin Daggers), and are capable of drawing enemies nearby with aoe attacks. Gear management is a very important part of using Double Sabers. Generally regarded as mobbing weapons for a long time, the addition of the Skill Ring L/DS Whirlwind allows Double Sabers to become an extremely effective boss killer in addition to its mobbing capabilities. Double Sabers can be powered up with the Skill '''Double Saber Gear''' to execute their Weapon Action.  
> Double Saber's Weapon Action is ''Kamaitachi''. When activated with the Weapon Action button, the wielder flourishes the weapon in the air. When used in tandem with '''Double Saber Gear''', using it while at least one Gear Level is stocked will deplete your Gear Gauge and summon a whirlwind around you that deals repeated damage to enemies close to you. This whirlwind can be stacked up to two times. The more Gear is consumed upon activation, the more damage the whirlwind deals and the longer the duration.

**Knuckles**
> A twin pair of weaponized gauntlets. Knuckles possess notoriously short range, but exceed even Swords in power to compensate. Their Photon Arts can hit extremely hard if given the opportunity, and are a powerful weapon when engaging a target one-on-one. Knuckles can be powered up with the Skill '''Knuckles Gear''', which grants its user a power boost as long as the user continues a combo.  
> Knuckles' Weapon Action is ''Sway''. Pressing the Weapon Action button will cause the wielder to swiftly duck in place. This gives brief invulnerability and does not break combos for the purpose of '''Tech Arts''' and '''Knuckles Gear'''.

When you reach Lv.75 as a Fighter, you can unlock a <a href="#">**Title Reward**</a> which grants you **PP +2, S-ATK +50, T-ATK +15, and T-DEF +10**.

<h3 id="gunner">Gunner (GU)</h3>
A class that utilizes **Twin Machine Guns** in a unique style of "ranged" combat. Gunner specializes in dealing very high burst damage at close range. It also has access to **Rifles** as a sidearm, with the same set of PAs used by Rangers.

<strong>ARKS-Visiphone Wiki description on Gunner's weaponry:</strong>

**Twin Machine Guns**
> Extremely versatile ranged weapons that serves as the primary weapon of Gunners. They deal relatively small amounts of damage. However, they make up for it with the number of hits that they can deal in a given amount of time. While TMGs are considered as a Ranged weapon, their hit range is of Medium to Point-Blank range. Twin Machineguns can be powered up with the use of the Skill '''Twin Machineguns Gear''', which grants them a damage bonus as they stay on the offensive and avoid taking damage.  
> Twin Machineguns' Weapon Action is ''Stylish Roll''. Pressing the Weapon Action button will cause the wielder to flip in a direction. The direction of flip can be influenced with the directional keys, and while only backwards and sideways flips can be performed by default, the Skill Ring L/Front S Roll enables Stylish Rolling in a forwards direction. Stylish Rolling is a dodge action with several unique properties.
> * Stylish Roll has a healthy amount of invulnerability frames that enable its wielder to evade attacks Dive Roll wouldn't be able to avoid.
> * Chaining three Stylish Rolls together causes the third roll to be performed in slow motion. This is the longest dodge action in the game and has the most invulnerability, surpassing even Mirage Escape.
> * Pressing the Attack button during a Stylish Roll will cause the wielder to fire at targets, restoring PP.
> * Stylish Roll creates a Just Attack circle after being performed, allowing the wielder to chain into Arts out of dodges.

**Rifles**
See <a href="#ranger">Ranger</a>.

When you reach Lv.75 as a Gunner, you can unlock a <a href="#">**Title Reward**</a> which grants you **PP +2, S-ATK +15, R-ATK +50, and S-DEF +10**.

<h3 id="techer">Techer (TE)</h3>
A hybrid melee class with access to techs. Techer's skills provide strong offensive bonuses for **Wands**/techs and unique support capabilities, allowing a Techer to be offensive and supportive at the same time. It also has access to **Talises** and **Compound Techs**. It is regarded as one of the best support classes that is still capable of competitive DPS.

<strong>ARKS-Visiphone Wiki description on Techer's weaponry:</strong>

**Wands**
> Wands are general purpose Technique casting weapons with a sizable amount of base T-ATK. They also have good S-ATK, as they are able to be used in melee combat, thanks to the Techer's skills in their tree. Wands can be powered up with the Skill Wand Gear, which allows them to create Technique "explosions" when striking enemies with melee attacks that inflict additional damage and strike all enemies near the blast.

**Talises**
See <a href="force">Force</a>.

When you reach Lv.75 as a Techer, you can unlock a <a href="#">**Title Reward**</a> which grants you **PP +2, S-ATK +15, T-ATK +50, and R-DEF +10**.

<h3 id="braver">Braver (BR)</h3>
A hybrid class that focuses on 2 different playstyles. Using **Katanas**, Braver excels at close range melee combat with high mobility. On the contrary, using **Bullet Bows**, Braver can deal strong burst damage from long range with high precision.

<strong>ARKS-Visiphone Wiki description on Braver's weaponry:</strong>

**Katanas**
> Katanas are short-ranged melee weapons that strike a delicate balance between versatility and elegance. Katana has a PA for every situation and uses them with spectacular coolness that captivates the hearts of both allies and enemies. While the Katana's power is overall average, it can string together easy combos that grant it a damage-per-second ratio rivaling the Hunter's Swords. Katana rewards players for precision and timing with its unique mechanic of Just Charge, which is present in several Katana PA's and increases their power if they are charged and released at the right moment. Despite being versatile, Katanas have practically no long-range capabilities without exposing oneself to danger. Katanas can be powered up with the Skill '''Katana Gear''', which, following a successful Just Guard, will envelop the wielder in an aura that boosts their S-ATK and Critical Hit Rate.  
> Katana's Weapon Action is ''Guard''. By holding the Weapon Action Button, any frontal attack dealt to you will inflict sharply reduced damage and minimal knockback at the cost of PP. Katanas have an innate Just Guard function included; pressing the Weapon Action Button right before an attack connects will completely negate the incoming attack's damage, and the player will counterattack with a powerful strike that activates Katana Gear.

**Bullet Bows**
> If the Katana is the heated coolness of the Braver, the Bullet Bow is its cold majesty. Complementing perfectly the Katana's close-range potential, the Bullet Bow offers great long-range coverage. Contrary to the Katana, the Bullet Bow's attacks are generally not as extravagant, shooting cold, unfeeling arrows with a solidified intent to kill. The Bullet Bow's accuracy is also dependant on stability: standing still will allow its arrows to hit more consistently their target while running-&-gunning will result in more than a few missed shots. Some of the Bullet Bow's PA's also require and enable followups and setups by combining different PA's into an excedingly high single-target damage burst. Despite some of its PA's actually being Strike Attacks instead of Ranged, the Bullet Bow does quite poorly in close quarters combat or against multiple targets.

When you reach Lv.75 as a Braver, you can unlock a <a href="#">**Title Reward**</a> which grants you **PP +2, S-ATK +20, R-ATK +20, and DEX +30**.

<h3 id="bouncer">Bouncer (BO)</h3>
From a certain Bouncer guide:<br>
> Bouncer is a class that boasts usage of S-ATK and T-ATK with access to technics to supplement its low amount of Photon Arts, all of which are scaled from S-ATK. With this in its arsenal, it has the second highest normal attack damage and all of its damage options boast gratuitous hitboxes as both a big strength and weakness.

The Jet Boots are an iconic weapon that allows on-the-fly elemental attribute changes, allowing for quick bursts in short phase rotations. Think of a highly mobile Gandalf from Lord of the Rings with [Mexican Pointy Boots](https://i.imgur.com/KIhhC1a.png) and the ability to cast magic from them.

They also use Dual Blades, which are two short swords that go on each hand. They have the ability to throw mini projectiles called **Photon Blades** using their gear gauge via their **Weapon Action**.

Using **[Weapon Camos](../basics/game-basics#weapon-camos)**, you can even cosplay [Kirito](https://i.imgur.com/JaVC43j.png) and [Roxas](http://mmoloda.com/pso2/image.php?id=116911)!

**Skill Tree overview:** <a href="https://pso2.arks-visiphone.com/wiki/Bouncer#Skill_Tree_Overview" target="_blank">Link</a>.

<h3 id="summoner">Summoner (SU)</h3>
A class that uses **Pets** in combat. Summoner's playstyle is vastly different from other classes, utilizing **Takts** to command **Pets** to attack while at the same time providing various supports for their **Pets**. The wide range of **Pets** in its arsenal allows the class to be effective in almost any situation. It also has access to techs.

<strong>ARKS-Visiphone Wiki description on Summoner's weaponry:</strong>

**Takts**
> A small baton used to control Pets. Unlike most other weapons, Takts bear several unique properties. Takts are largely useless as actual weapons, only capable of inflicting a pitifully weak Striking attack in point-blank range that restores no PP. Instead, Pets are bound to Takts and are summoned while your Takt is out. Pets take the place of weaponry for Summoner, armed with their own Photon Arts and attacks as well.

When you reach Lv.75 as a Summoner, you can unlock a <a href="#">**Title Reward**</a> which grants you **HP +10, S-DEF +40, R-DEF +40, and T-DEF +40**.

# Successor Classes
Unlike the 9 previous classes, Successor Classes are powerful classes that use weaponry from the other classes with new abilities and skills. Because of this, they're unable to use subclasses when used as a main class. However, only Phantom and Etoile can be used as a subclass, but are unable to use their PAs unless they're set as the main class.

You're able to play a Successor Class by leveling two classes to Lv.75 and completing a [Client Order](#).

<h3 id="hero">Hero (HR)</h3>
A class that specializes in fighting groups of enemies. Utilizing Swords, Twin Machineguns and Talises, Heroes are able to handle all combat situations with ease, using their superior offensive abilities and agility; as well as their ability to seamlessly cycle their weapons mid-combo.

#### Weapon differences between other classes
|**Swords**|**Twin Machineguns**|**Talises**|
|----------|--------------------|-----------|
| Swords are held with one hand, instead of being held with two. Thus allowing for faster swinging animations. | Twin Machineguns lack the stylish roll ability from Gunner. | Talis has its own Photon Arts. Is also capable of using techs. |
| Weapon Action: **Energy Blast** - Fire bolts of Photon energy. Long pressing charges the blast and lets you fire an even larger bolt. | Normal attacks consume PP. | Weapon action: **Agile Shift** - Allows you to set a warp point by long pressing the Weapon Action button, short tapping the Weapon Action button will cause you to teleport to that location. |
| | Weapon action: **Reload** - Recovers PP by twirling your TMGs. By doing a JA on a Reload will perform a Just Reload, which is a faster PP regeneration. | Can perform Step Attacks instead of Mirage Step. |
